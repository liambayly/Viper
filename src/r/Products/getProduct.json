            "description": "Karbolyn® represents the dawn of a new era of carbohydrate supplementation. Unlike other carbohydrate sources, Karbolyn® is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream like a simple sugar but without the typical spike or crash caused when your muscles run out of fuel.* In fact, Karbolyn® is a 'homopolysaccharide' (relatively complex carbohydrate), suggested to be absorbed 18.21% faster than pure Dextrose (a simple carbohydrate).* Yet it still promotes the sustained energy of complex carbohydrates.*"
